    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <!--Items in this section displayed with tabs that open to reveal paragraphs-->
    <p>Matt is a designer, web developer, and music producer based in Portland, Oregon. Having spent over a decade working in hospitality, he has a keen ability to anticipate the wants and needs of consumers. As a sommelier, he's used to synthesizing large amounts of information and later recalling that information to improve the guest experience on the spot.</p>
    <p>Recognizing the growing need for thoughtful programmers as we increasingly rely on technology to enhance real world experience, Matt hopes to bring a user centered hospitality to his work as a web developer. His creativity and eye for design allow him to create applications that are not only intuitive, but also a pleasure to use. </p>
